# [626. Exchange Seats](https://leetcode.com/problems/exchange-seats/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
```SQL
Table: Seat

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.
 
Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Explanation: 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

```SQL
# 1.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

select * from (
select s1.id as id,s2.student 
from Seat s1, Seat s2 where s1.id%2=1 and s1.id+1=s2.id
union 
select s1.id as id,s2.student from Seat s1, Seat s2 where s1.id%2=0 and s1.id-1=s2.id
union
select s.id as id,s.student as student from Seat s where s.id%2=1 and s.id=(select count(*) from Seat)
) as Result
order by id;

# 2.

SELECT id, 
       CASE 
           WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Seat) THEN 
               (SELECT student FROM Seat WHERE Seat.id = s.id + 1)
           WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN 
               (SELECT student FROM Seat WHERE Seat.id = s.id - 1)
           ELSE 
               student
       END AS student
FROM Seat s
ORDER BY id;
